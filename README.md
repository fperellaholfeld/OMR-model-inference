# YOLOv8 training submodule for OMR tool Model Generation

This repository contains the submodule for the [Owlmark Capstone Project](https://github.com/UBCO-COSC499-Summer-2024/team-7-capstone-team-7-falcon).

## Corpus

The labelled training corpus of mock submissions used when training the models can be found on [this Roboflow public repository](https://universe.roboflow.com/owlmark/omr-question-detection)

**Note:** If you plan on expanding the corpus with real student submissions, fork and download the corpus on you device, then add and label the new submissions. **Roboflow is not an appropriate place to store real student data**
